// Package gwmw is the gateway's middleware point (P3 of
// docs/subsystems/plugin-runtime.md): what changes a request on its way
// through the gateway and its reply on the way back. It has two places,
// each with its own failure policy:
//
//   - Agent: a request an agent sent, in the agent's own API, before the
//     gateway routes it, and its reply as the agent gets it. The JS gateway
//     middleware (internal/middleware) is the one there, registered by
//     plugins/middleware. It fails open: a middleware that fails leaves the
//     request as it was. A Run that is also Tried changes the body again
//     for each provider the gateway tries the request on.
//   - Masker: what magpie sends to a vendor, masked as the settings say,
//     and what the vendor answers with the values back. The redact plugin
//     registers it. It fails closed: when the settings ask for masking and
//     no masker is served, or the masker fails, nothing is sent.
