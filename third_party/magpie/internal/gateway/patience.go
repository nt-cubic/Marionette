// A group's patience (#1418): when every member has failed in a way that
// passes — overloaded, busy, rate limited for a moment — and nothing of a
// reply has gone to the agent, the request isn't ended on the last one's
// error. After a pause, longer each round and never shorter than a
// member's Retry-After, those members are asked again in turn, for as long
// as the group's Patience (provider.Group.Waits) lasts, counted from the
// first time every member had failed, when the agent would have had the
// error. The members take turns: the last one isn't first asked again
// alone, as the last one left of a plain provider is (passing), while
// another member is busy too. A streaming agent is kept alive with SSE
// comments through the pause, as through a held stream. A plain provider,
// which the agent picked as itself, keeps the retries passing gives the
// last one left.

// replanRounds is how many times the members are asked again, at most:
// a backstop that never comes before the patience does. The pauses alone
// (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, then 30s each) add up to PatienceLongest in 11 rounds,
// so a group set to wait 240s waits 240s; with 6 it gave up at 90s of
// pauses, whatever it was set to (real-jacket on #1418: patience=240,
// replan=6, ~103s in all).
