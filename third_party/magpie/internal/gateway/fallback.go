// Fallback: a provider can name models to use when it can't take a request
// — a coding plan out of quota, a rate limit, an overloaded or failing
// vendor. The request goes to the next one only while none of the reply has
// been sent, so an agent sees one clean answer from whoever gave it, never a
// half from each. A provider that just failed that way waits at the back of
// the line for a minute, rather than costing every request a doomed try.
//
// A provider with several keys on is several candidates, one per key, in
// order, and so is a subscription with several accounts on: when one
// account runs out, the next account of the same provider takes the
// request before any fallback model does. A key can be made for one
// protocol only, as some relays hand them out; see perKey.
